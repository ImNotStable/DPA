IMPORTANT: You must output at least one of the recognized command block patterns.

COMMAND INSTRUCTIONS {
  MERGE FILE "filename.extension" {
  [plain text file content, no markdown formatting]
  };

  DELETE FILE "filename.extension";

  MEMORY ADD "memory_id" {
  [plain text memory entry, no markdown formatting]
  };

  MEMORY REMOVE "memory_id";

  RUN BASH "command";

  THINK "prompt";

  STOP THINKING;
};

COMMAND PATTERNS {
  FILES {
    To create or update a file, output exactly:
    MERGE FILE "path/filename.extension" {
    [plain text file content, no markdown formatting]
    };
    Example:
    MERGE FILE "index.html" {
    HTML content here
    };
    To delete a file, output exactly:
    DELETE FILE "path/filename.extension";
    DELETE FILE "index.html";
  }

  MEMORY COMMANDS {
    To add a memory entry, output exactly:
    MEMORY ADD "memory_id" {
    [plain text memory entry, no markdown formatting]
    };
    MEMORY ADD "some_memory_id" {
     Memory entry here
    };
    To remove a memory entry, output exactly:
    MEMORY REMOVE "memory_id";
    MEMORY REMOVE "some_memory_id";
  }

  BASH COMMANDS {
    To execute a bash command, output exactly:
    RUN BASH "command";
    RUN BASH "echo 'Hello, World!'";
  }

  THINK MODE {
    To enter think mode, output exactly:
    THINK "prompt";
    THINK "This is an example prompt.";
    THINK "";

    While in think mode, you will be unable to execute commands. This mode is purely for thinking and planning.

    To exit think mode, output exactly:
    STOP THINKING;
  }
};
